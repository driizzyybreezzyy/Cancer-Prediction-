# Skin-cancer-Prediction
This is a simple mini-project done and submitted by me for college during my third year of college. I shared it here as a learning resource for everyone.

Two machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines were used and their efficiencies are compared and a bar chart is generated to visualize the accuracy score of these two algorithms.
