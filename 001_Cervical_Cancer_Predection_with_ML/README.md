# Cervical Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning 🌟

Hey there! As a fellow final-year computer science student, I totally get the hustle of juggling projects, exams, and late-night coding sessions. Let's dive into this cervical cancer prediction project – it's like debugging life, but with data! 🤓

## The Quest for Insights 🌐

### Data Source 📊

So, picture this: I stumbled upon this treasure trove of data from "Hospital Universitario de Caracas" in Caracas, Venezuela. It's like finding a rare Pokémon card in a dusty old box – exciting stuff! 🎮

The dataset includes features like:
- **Number of Pregnancies**: Because, well, life begins there! 🤰
- **Smoking Habits**: Puff, puff, pass... the data, of course! 🚬
- **Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)**: Not the kind of STD you're thinking about – it's all about data hygiene here! 🦠
- **Demographics**: Age, education, and other cool stuff. 🕶️
- **Historic Medical Records**: The patient's past – like a codebase with commit history! 📜

### Data Wrangling 🧹

First, I had to clean up the data. Imagine untangling a bunch of headphone wires – that's what I did. Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and made sure everything played nicely together. 🎧

### Splitting the Gang 👥

Next, I divided the dataset into two squads:
- **Training Team**: These data points are like my loyal sidekicks. They'll help me train our model. 💪
- **Test Team**: These guys are my secret agents. They'll test the model's mettle. 🕵️‍♂️

## The Magic Potion: XG-Boost 🪄

I brewed up an XG-Boost potion – a powerful elixir for classification tasks. It's like Red Bull for algorithms – gives 'em wings! 🚀

### Training the Model 🤖

I fed the training team to the XG-Boost dragon. It learned patterns, tweaked its weights, and became smarter than my AI ethics textbook. 📚

### Accuracy Spell ✨

The moment of truth! Drumroll, please... 🥁

- **Training Dataset Accuracy**: 99.562% (Whoa, overachiever!)
- **Test Dataset Accuracy**: 95.348% (Pretty darn good!)

## Conclusion 🎉

So, there you have it – our trusty model can predict cervical cancer risk better than a fortune teller with a crystal ball. 🌟

Keep coding, stay caffeinated, and remember: Life is like a nested loop – sometimes you break out, and sometimes you just keep iterating! 🤓💻
